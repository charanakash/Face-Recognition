# Face-Recognition

## Situation:
- Company X wanted to build a strong face identification system with high accuracy. The most important part of this system was a high-quality dataset of aligned faces for training and testing the face recognition model.


## Task:
- Develop a large, diverse dataset of aligned faces to be used in building Company X's face identification system. The dataset should include a large number of images of different individuals with a wide range of facial characteristics.
- Images should be aligned correctly to ensure that the model performs optimally with consistent feature extraction.

## Action:
- Collected a large dataset of images from Pinterest, which is known for its diverse and visually rich content.
- Used the dlib library to align faces in each image correctly so that facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth) are consistently placed across the dataset.
- Cleaned and processed the dataset by removing low-quality images and ensuring data consistency.
- Organized and labeled the dataset for efficient use in model training and evaluation.

## Result:
- High-quality, face-aligned dataset of 10,770 images of 100 individuals was created.
- This dataset was a strong basis for the development of an accurate face identification model.
- It has played a very important role in the success of Company X's face recognition project.
- Demonstrated skill in gathering data, processing images, and creating datasets for applications in machine learning.
